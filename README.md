## ðŸš¨ Forking this Repo (Please Read!)

Iâ€™m excited to keep this site open source and welcome folks to study or even reuse parts of it for their own projects! However, please remember **attribution is important**.

This website structure is originally derived from [Brittany Chiangâ€™s v4 website](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4). The design and code snippets here are heavily inspired by her work. I spent time customizing it to suit my personal website needs, and Iâ€™m proud of the result. If you decide to reuse or adapt any part of this repository, please **give proper credit** to both me and Brittany by linking back to [shreyassk.com](https://shreyassk.com) and [brittanychiang.com](https://brittanychiang.com).
